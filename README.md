# SimpleNav
Remove unwanted DOM elements from specific websites using custom CSS selectors

Take control of your browsing experience.

Are you tired of massive cookie banners taking up half the screen? Frustrated by "Subscribe Now" popups that won't close? Or websites that disable your scroll bar?

SimpleNav is a Chrome/Firefox extension that will become the ultimate power tool for users who want a cleaner, faster, and distraction-free web. Unlike standard ad-blockers that work on general lists, SimpleNav lets you decide exactly what stays and what goes.

With a simple and organized interface, you can create custom rules to remove elements, modify styles, or manage CSS classes on any domain.

### [Install as Google Chrome Extension here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/simplenav/kejbfjkdgoallacidfpblpkghecfnelj)

## 🚀 Key Features:
- **🗑️ Delete Anything:** Zap annoying headers, floating banners, chatbots, or footer overlays with a simple CSS selector.
- **🔓 Unblock Scrolling:** Did a popup lock your screen? Use the "Remove Style" or "Set CSS" feature to force overflow: auto on the body and get your scroll back.
- **✨ Modify Layouts:** Add or remove CSS classes to fix broken layouts, remove blur effects on content, or adjust visuals to your liking.
- **📂 Smart Organization:** Rules are automatically grouped by domain in a clean Accordion View. Manage 10 or 100 rules easily without the clutter.
- **⚡ Lightning Fast:** Runs immediately when the page loads (document_end) to minimize layout shifts and flickering.

## 🛠️ What can you do with SimpleNav?
- **Remove Elements:** Target #promo-banner and it's gone forever.
- **Remove Classes:** Strip away .blurred-text or .modal-open classes that ruin your reading experience.
- **Force CSS Styles:** Inject position: relative !important to stop sticky headers from following you.
